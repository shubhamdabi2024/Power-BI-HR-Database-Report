## Overview
- The HR dashboard for SHUBH presents key employee statistics including a workforce of 311 employees, an average salary of 69,021, and an average age of 46.41 years. Visualizations like bar and pie charts display data on recruitment sources, department distribution, age and gender demographics, performance scores, termination reasons, and marital status. The dashboard highlights that most employees were recruited through Indeed and LinkedIn, with the production department being the largest, and shows that the majority of employees are in the 36-45 age group and meet performance expectations.
- This chart provides a visual representation of employee headcount and attrition trends over time. The top chart shows the yearly headcount, indicating a steady increase in the number of employees from 2008 to 2016. The bottom chart illustrates yearly attrition, revealing fluctuations in employee turnover rates throughout the years.
